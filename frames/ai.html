        <p><span>Artificial Intelligence</span> refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. In the field of computer science artificial intelligence is referred to as machine intelligence. Machine Intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by the animals and humans.
        Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of “intelligence agents”: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize the chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially the term “artificial intelligence” is often used to describe machines that mimic “cognitive” functions that humans associate with human mind, such as “learning” and “problem solving”.
        Artificial Intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1995 and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism. For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. These subfields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals, the use of particular tools or deep philosophical differences. Subfields have also been based on social factors.
        As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require “intelligence” are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler’s Theorem says “AI is whatever has not been done yet”. For instance ,optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology. Modern Machine capabilities generally classified as Ai include successfully understanding human speech, competition at highest level in strategic game systems, autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.
